      * Joined as a Python software engineer, building early, massively viral social games on Facebook platform.
      
      * Transitioned to being an Engineering Manager for four engineers.

      #### Software Engineer
      
      * Spent ten years writing code and building interesting things at companies like Bose, Current TV and Sapient.
