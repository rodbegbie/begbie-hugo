  ## What People are Saying About Me?

testimonial:
  - name: VP Engineering
    comment: I've been meeting with Rod for a few months now and he's had insightful guidance on our big-picture strategic initiatives as well as the smaller-scale, sometimes interpersonal, tactical issues that come up in a leadership role.
    time: 75 person SaaS company
    star: 0
  - name: Senior Software Engineer & Tech Lead
    comment: I've spent so much time just focusing on mastering product development I didn't have a good system for thinking about engineering leadership or for considering my options. With Rod's coaching I was able to level up my leadership skills and get better at showing coworkers those skills. Most importantly, Rod helped me develop a way to think about the different paths in engineering leadership and to work through my doubts about considering management as a viable path.
